### **Promotional Text (170 chars)**
The only habit tracker with Permadeath. Your digital twin evolves as you succeed—or dies if you fail. Miss a day, lose everything. Are you strong enough?

### **Description**
**WEAKNESS IS A CHOICE. THIS SOFTWARE REMOVES THAT OPTION.**

Optimal Protocol is not a checklist. It is a **Cybernetic Life Simulator** linked directly to your daily discipline. You are the Operator. The **Cyber-Construct** is your digital soul.

If you slack off, it glitches and decays. If you dominate, it evolves into a **GODLIKE** state.

### 💀 HARDCORE MODE (PERMADEATH)
This is the feature that separates the elite from the casuals.
- **The Contract:** If you miss **ONE DAY**, your entire existence (Streak, Level, Avatar) is **TERMINATED**.
- **System Failure:** The interface bleeds red. Alarms sound. Your avatar decays instantly.
- **No Mercy:** There is no undo button.

### 🤖 THE BIO-LINK AVATAR
Your twin is a procedural 3D entity that physically transforms based on your habits.
- **Strength:** Training habits increase muscle mass.
- **Resilience:** Recovery habits thicken armor plating.
- **Intellect:** Knowledge habits enhance the neural core.
- **Retro-Engine:** Rendered in raw 120Hz with custom Metal shaders for a gritty PS1/90s FPS aesthetic.

### 👁️ OMNIPRESENCE
The protocol does not sleep.
- **Tactical Widgets:** Monitor your integrity directly from the Home Screen.
- **Haptic Feedback:** Feel the weight of every completed task with heavy, industrial vibrations.
- **Drill Sergeant:** Morning directives and evening status checks ensure you never forget your mission.

**JOIN THE ELITE.**
Most apps want you to feel good. Optimal Protocol wants you to **BE BETTER**.
