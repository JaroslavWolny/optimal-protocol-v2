## 💀 WHAT IS THIS?

**OPTIMAL PROTOCOL** is not a "habit tracker". It is a **Digital Drill Sergeant**. It is a **Psychological Framework** encoded into silicon.

We have abandoned the limitations of standard apps. We have forged a **Hybrid God Stack** that combines the raw speed of the web with the visceral power of native hardware.

**Your Mission:** Feed the **Cyber-Construct**. It is your digital soul.
-   **Train.** It grows.
-   **Slack off.** It rots.
-   **Fail.** It dies. (Permadeath is real).

## 🚀 THE ARMORY (TECH STACK)

We don't use "frameworks". We use **Weapons of Mass Construction**.

### 🧠 THE BRAIN: React + Vite
The neural network. Instant state updates. Zero latency. The speed of thought.

### 🌉 THE BRIDGE: Capacitor.js (Native Core)
We have breached the walled garden.
-   **Haptics:** Feel every rep. The phone physically recoils when you complete a task.
-   **Filesystem:** Local encrypted storage for offline survival.
-   **Notifications:** The system screams at you if you forget your duty.

### 👁️ THE VISUAL CORTEX: React Three Fiber (WebGL)
-   **Procedural Avatar:** A 3D representation of your physical state.
-   **Custom Shaders:** "Retro-Glitch", "Scanlines", and "Hologram" effects written in raw GLSL.
-   **60 FPS:** Smoothness is mandatory.

### ☁️ THE OVERMIND: Supabase (Edge Functions)
-   **The Reaper:** A server-side Edge Function that monitors your vital signs 24/7.
-   **Anti-Cheat:** Row Level Security (RLS) ensures you cannot fake your progress.
-   **Real-time Sync:** Your discipline is backed up to the cloud instantly.

## 🛠️ INITIATION SEQUENCE (DEPLOYMENT)

### 📱 PHASE 1: iOS HYBRID DEPLOYMENT
1.  **Compile Core:** `npm run build`
2.  **Inject Native Code:** `npx cap sync`
3.  **Breach Xcode:** `npx cap open ios`
4.  **Execute:** Select your device and hit **PLAY**.

### 🌐 PHASE 2: WEB DEPLOYMENT (VERCEL)
1.  **Install CLI:** `npm i -g vercel`
2.  **Deploy:** Run `vercel` in the root.
3.  **Configure Env:**
    -   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: [CLASSIFIED]
    -   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: [CLASSIFIED]

### ☁️ PHASE 3: SERVER MIGRATION (CRITICAL)
**WARNING:** Without this, the system is toothless.
1.  Navigate to **Supabase Dashboard -> SQL Editor**.
2.  Execute `supabase/server_logic.sql`.
3.  **Deploy The Reaper:**
    ```bash
    supabase functions deploy monitor-vital-signs --no-verify-jwt
    ```
    *This activates the server-side kill switch.*

## ⚠️ FINAL WARNING

This software tracks **Consistency**, not just activity.
If you miss a day in **Hardcore Mode**, your avatar is deleted. Your streak is zeroed. Your shame is public.

**DISCIPLINE IS THE ONLY CURRENCY THAT MATTERS.**

*System Online. Awaiting Input.*
