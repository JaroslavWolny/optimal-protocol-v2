# ⚡ OPTIMAL PROTOCOL // NATIVE (v4.0)

**THE ULTIMATE DISCIPLINE MACHINE.**

> "Weakness is a choice. This software removes that option."

**OPTIMAL PROTOCOL** has evolved. We have abandoned the constraints of the web browser. This is no longer a JavaScript toy. This is a **NATIVE iOS WEAPON** built for maximum performance, zero latency, and aggressive psychological re-wiring.

You are the Operator. The **Cyber-Construct** is your digital soul. Feed it with discipline, or watch it rot in high-definition 120Hz.

## 🚀 THE GOD STACK (iOS NATIVE)

We have migrated to a pure, bleeding-edge Apple ecosystem stack to achieve **GODLIKE** performance.

-   **CORE:** **Swift 6.0** (The language of the gods)
-   **UI:** **SwiftUI** with Glassmorphism & ZStack layering.
-   **ENGINE:** **SceneKit** (Replacing React Three Fiber for raw native 3D performance).
-   **VISUALS:** **Metal Shaders (MSL)**. Custom GPU pipelines for "Scanlines", "Glitch", and "Pixelation" effects. No CSS filters allowed.
-   **HAPTICS:** **Core Haptics**. Complex vibration textures. Feel the weight of your success.
-   **DATA:** **Supabase (Swift)**. Real-time synchronization.

## 💀 HARDCORE MODE (PERMADEATH)

**⚠️ WARNING: EXTREME DISCIPLINE REQUIRED.**

-   **The Contract:** If you miss **ONE DAY**, your entire existence (Streak, Level, Avatar) is **TERMINATED**.
-   **System Failure:** The interface bleeds red. Alarms sound. Your avatar decays instantly.
-   **No Mercy:** There is no undo button.

## 🤖 THE DOOM AVATAR (NATIVE)

Your digital twin is now a **Procedural SceneKit Entity**.

-   **Dynamic Morphology:** Muscles grow with 'Strength' habits. Armor plates thicken with 'Resilience'.
-   **Retro-Rendering:** The 3D scene is passed through a custom **Metal Pixelation Shader** to mimic the raw, jagged aesthetic of 1995 FPS games.
-   **12 FPS Animation:** We artificially limit the animation frame rate to capture that crunchy stop-motion feel, while the camera glides at a buttery 120Hz.
